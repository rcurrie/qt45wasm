That WAT code failed to compile with error:
{error}

Common SIMD WAT mistakes to avoid:
- v128.load and v128.store take an i32 address on the stack, e.g. (v128.load (i32.const 0))
- f32x4.add, f32x4.mul, f32x4.sub take two v128 operands, not scalars
- Memory must be declared and exported: (memory (export "memory") 1)
- Loop index must step by 16 (bytes), not by 4 (elements) or 1
- NEVER use numeric type/function indices like (type 0) — use inline types only
- Use named locals with $ prefix: (local $i i32), (local.get $i), (local.set $i ...)
- Result type must be i32 (the byte offset of the result in memory)

Fix the code. Output ONLY the corrected WAT module starting with (module and ending with ).
